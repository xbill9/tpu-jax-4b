# CPU debug box: the same JAX stack as the TPU VMs, minus libtpu.
#
# Purpose is correctness work, not benchmarking. A host with enough RAM can load
# the real checkpoints (31B at W4A16 is ~16 GB of weights) and run the engine
# through JAX's CPU backend unchanged — `w4a16_impl` defaults to the reference
# path and Pallas auto-switches to interpret mode off-TPU. Architecture bugs are
# reproducible here for cents an hour instead of TPU rates.
#
# Mirror all output to the serial console: SSH is often blocked by firewall policy
# and the serial log is then the only way to watch boot progress.
